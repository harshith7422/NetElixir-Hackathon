## Title: Hyper-Personalized Landing Page Generator Agent
## 🌟 Objective
Develop an AI-powered prototype that can dynamically generate hyper-personalized landing
pages for new or guest users visiting an eCommerce website. The solution should intelligently
recommend content and product modules based on inferred patterns of past user behavior,
demographics, and transaction trends. Importantly, the prototype must also incorporate a
strategy to address the cold start problem often encountered in recommendation engines.

## ✍🏻 Problem Statement
Today, digital commerce platforms are flooded with data, but struggle to personalize
experiences for users with little to no history — such as first-time or anonymous visitors. Most
recommendation systems rely heavily on behavioral or transactional history, and their
effectiveness is limited in "cold start" scenarios where data about the user is not yet available.
Your task is to build a Hyper-Personalized Landing Page Generator Agent that can:
1. Analyze patterns in historical data to infer user interests and segment preferences.
2. Recommend personalized landing page modules (e.g., hero images, product
carousels, CTAs) for incoming new users based on matching behavioral/demographic
signals.
3. Solve the cold start problem by designing fallback strategies using available attributes
like region, device type, traffic source, demographic cohort, and general trends.
In essence, the system should behave like an intelligent concierge for first-time visitors, tailoring
the website experience based on what it has learned from past user behavior.
